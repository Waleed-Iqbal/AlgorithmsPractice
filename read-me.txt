An attempt to implement all of the algorithms mention in following Quora's page in JavaScript

All the test inputs need to be an object. Where key is the name of the input and value is the input itself.
The same goes for output as well.

let testInput = {
  numbers: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
}


The function containing the algorithm will expect an argument of input while output will be an object as described above.


The input object will be defined in the algorithm file.


use the global function "testSolution" to test your solution. First argument is the function, second argument is test input object and
third argument is the displaying option object which is like following
let displayOptions = {
  showInputs: true,
  showOutputs: true,
}
